# Lyrics EmoBERT: DIY Your Emotion Playlist in One Step

## Overview

### Introduction
EmoBERT is a playlist generator. Given the emotion, year, genre and the number of songs, the product can generate a playlist recommendation for users, which revolves around the advanced domain of Natural Language Processing, specifically focusing on sentiment analysis. The core model is finetuned from current huggingface SOTA model: Bert-base-uncased-emotion, reaching higher accuracy on the specific dataset.

### Approach
* Finetune the current SOTA model, based on the BERT architecture.
* Specialize in the task sentiment analysis of lyrics task.

## 🚀 Downstream Task
### Task: Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis)
The challenge: Text Classification with a twist of Emotion Analysis! 🎭📝

Our quest begins in the realm of sentiment, where words convey more than just meaning. However, the path isn't straightforward. The absence of a well-labeled, comprehensive dataset for song lyrics in this domain led us to merge multiple datasets, creating a unique blend suited for our purpose.
