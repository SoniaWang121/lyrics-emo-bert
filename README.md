EmoBERT is a playlist generator. Given the emotion, year, genre and the number of songs, the product can generate a playlist recommendation for users, which revolves around the advanced domain of Natural Language Processing, specifically focusing on sentiment analysis. The core model is finetuned from current huggingface SOTA model: Bert-base-uncased-emotion, reaching higher accuracy on the specific dataset.

### Approach
* Finetune the current SOTA model, based on the BERT architecture.
* Specialize in the task sentiment analysis of lyrics task.
