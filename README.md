# Lyrics EmoBERT: DIY Your Emotion Playlist in Single Step


## Overview

### Introduction
EmoBERT is a playlist generator. Given the emotion, year, genre and the number of songs, the product can generate a playlist recommendation for users, which revolves around the advanced domain of Natural Language Processing, specifically focusing on sentiment analysis. The core model is finetuned from current huggingface SOTA model: Bert-base-uncased-emotion, reaching higher accuracy on the specific dataset.

### Approach
Fine-tuning the current state-of-the-art model, based on the BERT architecture, to better suit the task of sentiment analysis on song lyrics. Fine-tuning involves adjusting a pre-trained model to specialize in the specific task (in this case, sentiment analysis of lyrics). 

The fine-tuned model is expected to demonstrate a heightened ability to analyze and interpret emotions in song lyrics accurately. This enhanced capability allows for a deeper understanding of the emotional landscape in musical content, potentially contributing to more emotionally intelligent AI applications, improved user experiences in music streaming services, and richer cultural and linguistic studies.
